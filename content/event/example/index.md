summary: Encapsulation of textile-based biosensor via photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition(piCVD)
abstract: 'Signal accuracy is compromised by surface fouling effects, which represent a major challenge to the continuous operation of wearable biosensors. Moreover, wearable biosensors can also be exposed to fluctuating conditions during prolonged outdoor activity that may affect the stability or activity of fragile bio-receptors. By introducing a thin hydrophobic encapsulation layer, poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl acrylate) (pTFOA), a textile-based electrochemical biosensor for sweat glucose monitoring with high sensitivity and repeatability was realized. The surface-restricted chain growth process via photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition(piCVD) afforded a strong interfacial adhesion between the pTFOA and textile substrate, which enabled pTFOA to cover the sensing surface, even after being subjected to numerous electrochemical scanning cycles. Meanwhile, the amorphous microstructure of the pTFOA film facilitated rapid ion and analyte diffusion through the encapsulation layer and, therefore, a quick sensing response and a well-defined calibration curve was obtained. Furthermore, due to its hydrophobicity, pTFOA was able to facilitate removal of adsorbed bio-macromolecules in body fluids by a limited shear force, like gentle rinsing, and therefore provided consistent data acquisition. These promising features of pTFOA synthesized via piCVD may serve as a new encapsulating idea to be applied to various sensors with different substrates and serve as a new strategy to extend the shelf life and functionality of wearable biosensors.'
