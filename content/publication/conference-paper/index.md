abstract: To produce next-generation, shelf-stable biosensors for point-of-
care diagnostics, a combination of rugged biomolecular recognition elements,
eﬃcient encapsulants, and innocuous deposition approaches is needed.
Furthermore, to ensure that the sensitivity and speciﬁcity that are inherent to
biological recognition elements are maintained in solid-state biosensing systems,
site-speciﬁc immobilization chemistries must be invoked such that the function
of the biomolecule remains unperturbed. In this work, we present a widely
applicable strategy to develop robust solid-state biosensors using emergent
nanobody (Nb) recognition elements coupled with a vapor-deposited polymer
encapsulation layer. As compared to conventional immunoglobulin G antibod-
ies, Nbs are smaller (12−15 kDa as opposed to ∼150 kDa), have higher thermal stability and pH tolerance, boast greater ease of
recombinant production, and are capable of binding antigens with high aﬃnity and speciﬁcity. Photoinitiated chemical vapor
deposition aﬀords thin, protective polymer barrier layers over immobilized Nb arrays that allow for retention of Nb activity and
speciﬁcity after both storage under ambient conditions and complete desiccation. Most importantly, we also demonstrate that vapor-
deposited polymer encapsulation of Nb arrays enables speciﬁc detection of target proteins in complex heterogeneous samples, such
as unpuriﬁed cell lysate, which is otherwise challenging to achieve with bare Nb arrays.
