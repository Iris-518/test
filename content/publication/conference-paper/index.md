abstract: To produce next-generation, shelf-stable biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics, a combination of rugged biomolecular recognition elements, efficient encapsulants, and innocuous deposition approaches is needed. Furthermore, to ensure that the sensitivity and specificity that are inherent to biological recognition elements are maintained in solid-state biosensing systems, site-specific immobilization chemistries must be invoked such that the function of the biomolecule remains unperturbed. In this work, we present a widely applicable strategy to develop robust solid-state biosensors using emergent nanobody (Nb) recognition elements coupled with a vapor-deposited polymer encapsulation layer. As compared to conventional immunoglobulin G antibodies, Nbs are smaller (12–15 kDa as opposed to ∼150 kDa), have higher thermal stability and pH tolerance, boast greater ease of recombinant production, and are capable of binding antigens with high affinity and specificity. Photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition affords thin, protective polymer barrier layers over immobilized Nb arrays that allow for retention of Nb activity and specificity after both storage under ambient conditions and complete desiccation. Most importantly, we also demonstrate that vapor-deposited polymer encapsulation of Nb arrays enables specific detection of target proteins in complex heterogeneous samples, such as unpurified cell lysate, which is otherwise challenging to achieve with bare Nb arrays.
