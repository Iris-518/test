abstract: Climate change is leading to increased concentrations of ground-level ozone in farms and orchards. Persistent
ozone exposure causes irreversible oxidative damage to plants and reduces crop yield, threatening food supply
chains. Here, we show that vapor-deposited conducting polymer tattoos on plant leaves can be used to perform
on-site impedance analysis, which accurately reveals ozone damage, even at low exposure levels. Oxidative
damage produces a unique change in the high-frequency (>104 Hz) impedance and phase signals of leaves, which
is not replicated by other abiotic stressors, such as drought. The polymer tattoos are resilient against ozone-
induced chemical degradation and persist on the leaves of fruiting plants, thus allowing for frequent and long-
term monitoring of cellular ozone damage in economically important crops, such as grapes and apples.
